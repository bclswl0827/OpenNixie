This is an OpenNixie time calibration program written in Python.

## Quick Start

On a Bluetooth-equipped Linux device (such as most laptops running Debian 11), then use the rfcomm tool to connect to OpenNixie.

Assuming the bluetooth has been paired and its MAC address is `00:00:00:00:00:00` as an example, an example is given below:

```bash
$ sudo rfcomm connect 0 00:00:00:00:00:00
```

Unsurprisingly, a device can be found in `/dev/rfcomm0`:

```bash
$ ls -l /dev/rfcomm0
crw-rw---- 1 root dialout 216, 0  9æœˆ  9 21:59 /dev/rfcomm0
```

Then, run this demo:

```bash
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$ python3 app.py
```

## Get Bluetooth MAC Address

Example of getting the MAC address of a Bluetooth device:

```bash
$ hcitool scan
Scanning ...
        00:00:00:00:00:00       JDY-33-SPP
```
